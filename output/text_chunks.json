    "text": "\u00a9 trmindtree\n\nAuditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable\nassurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect\na material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the\naudit. We also:\n\n\u00a2 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate\nto provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of\ninternal control.\n\n\u00a9 Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the\nParent has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating\neffectiveness of such controls.\n\n\u00a2 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures\nmade by the management.\n\n* Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit\nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\nability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw\nattention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are\ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's\nreport. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n\u00a2 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,\nand whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves\nfair presentation.\n\n\u00a2 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit\nof the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent\nauditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors,\nsuch other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We\nremain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes\nit probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be\ninfluenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating\nthe results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent and such other entities included in the consolidated financial\nstatements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit\nand significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements\nregarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear\non our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\n370 Our vision for a limitless future.
